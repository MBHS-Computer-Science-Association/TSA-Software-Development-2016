		<h1>Demonstration Info</h1>
			<p>This demo displays the use of an Artificial Neural Network in the identification of mutation in the EGFR gene, a gene which
			frequently mutates and is the baseline cause of lung cancer. For instance, a patient without cancer would have a non-mutated sequence
			of nucleotides in the EGFR gene, while a patient with lung cancer would have a mutated nucleotide sequence.<br><br><p>In this demo
			you can modify the sequence of nucleotides in the EGFR gene of a "patient" and a neural network will try to find the pattern in the nucleotide 
			sequence and identify if he has a mutated set of nucleotides or a non-mutated set. Furthermore, you can train the neural network
			to better identify whether or not the patient does have mutations in the EGFR gene.
