		<h1>Instructions</h1>
			<p>ANNs are used to identify mutation in genes. A mutated EGFR gene is a baseline cause of lung cancer and is a relatively common mutation. Some minor mutations may not result in lung cancer, so doctors need to determine which mutations may be harmful.

			<p>Doctors would be able to enter in the nucleotide sequence at the locus of EGFR for one of their patients. Training the neural network will expose the network to a file of known malignant mutations and let it discover patterns. Hitting the results button will return the network's prediction on whether the gene will be cancerous. Furthermore, you can train the neural network
			to better identify whether or not the patient does have mutations in the EGFR gene.

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not use this as professional medical advice. It is not perfect 100% of the time.
