		<h3>Genetic Algorithm</h3>
			<p>
				This algorithm works by generating several random neural networks and choosing the best one which has children that themselves compete againt each other. This continues until a child has a perfect neural network. The advantage of this is that it can work without well-defined test cases unlike backpropagation. The disadvantage is that it is slow and redundant.
