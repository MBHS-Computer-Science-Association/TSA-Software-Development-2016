		<h3>Backpropagation</h3>
			<p>
				Backpropagation is a relatively recent discovery in computer science. The idea is to consider a neural network as a many dimensional function. Weights are changed in O(N) time complexity by the derivation of each weight times the output error. The advantage to this is that it is faster and more accurate than all other learning algorithms. The disadvantage is that it requires clear testcases.
