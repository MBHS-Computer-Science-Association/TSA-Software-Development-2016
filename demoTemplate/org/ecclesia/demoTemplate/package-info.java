/**
 * Provides several reusable template classes that aid in the rapid creation of demos. 
 * Takes advantage of abstraction to reduce the amount of boilerplate code used to create 
 * a windowed interface and allows the team to focus on three aspects of the GUI:
 *  instructions, control, and content. This package includes classes that allow for 
 *  the three aspects to be put together in a fashion that provides congruency 
 *  across all of our demonstrations.
