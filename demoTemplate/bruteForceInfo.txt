		<h3>Brute Force Algorithm</h3>
			<p>
				The most naive of algorithms, this works by checked each possible weight combination and chooses the best ones. The advantage of this is unlike greedy algorithm, it is guaranteed to create the best network. The disadvantage is that it is extremely slow; the time of completion grows exponentially with the complexity of the network. Thus it is only suited for the simplest networks.
