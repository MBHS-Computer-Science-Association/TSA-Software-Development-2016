<html><body width='300'><h1>Demonstration Info</h1><p>This demo presents you with the training of a neural network &amp; allows simple user interactivity.  By clicking repeatedly from any random point and back again to the same point, you are training the neural network. The green dots are the random points you have inputted into the network, and the orangedot is the predicted output of the whole program after constant training of the component.<br><br><p>Although this demonstration shows our neural network, it is implementing a slow learning curve for accurate   results therefore it would take time to train our program. We have a second demonstration that has a lower learning curve therefore learns faster
