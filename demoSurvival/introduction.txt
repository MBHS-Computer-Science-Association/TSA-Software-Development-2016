		<h1>Instructions</h1>
			<p><font color="green">Malishes</font> are creatures that must search for <font color="blue">food</font> in order to survive. The ability to find <font color="blue">food</font> will determine if a <font color="green">Malish</font> will be able to spread its characteristics.

			<p>Primitive food-seeking models will just travel in a straight line. Others will spin in circles in hopes of finding <font color="blue">food</font>. Others will actually turn in response to food. The population eventually evolves into efficient eaters or it will completely die out.

			<p><strong>Backpropagation will increase the efficiency of evolving the networks.</strong> Enable it to see the difference with effective error minimization.
