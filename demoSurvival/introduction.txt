		<h1>Demonstration Info</h1>
			<p>This demo presents you with the training of a neural network. In this presentation we have created creatures dubbed <font color="green">Malishes (the green circles)</font>. If a piece of <font color="blue">food (the squares)</font> is in a <font color="green">Malish's</font> field of view, its relative postion is passed into a <font color="green">Malish's</font> neural network. These neural networks outputs whether the <font color="green">Malish</font> turns left, right, or continues straight. The Malishes that find <font color="blue">food</font> reproduced and pass on their networks to their children in which random mutations can improve them. If a <font color="green">Malish</font> fails to find food it turns <font color="yellow">yellow,</font> then <font color="red">red,</font> and eventually dies. Thus the <font color="green">Malish's</font> that have improved neural networks will survive longer and reproduce more offspring with the improved neural networks. This shows our neural network software toolkit and its powerful capabilities when implemented within a project
